# 2D-3D Credential Detection with Color & Face Matching using Monocular Vision



Developed a real-time monocular vision system capable of identifying and localizing color-coded ID cards in 3D space. The system uses OpenCV-based camera calibration, HSV color segmentation, contour filtering, and Haar-cascade face detection to verify valid IDs (e.g., "TEC" vs "UDEM") based on both visual color and facial presence. Combined with user-annotated 2Dâ€“3D correspondences, the system estimates depth and orientation from a single RGB camera feed, enabling distance calculation and visual confirmation.
